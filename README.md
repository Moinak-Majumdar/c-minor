31. Convert a given number (in seconds) to hours, minutes, and seconds using a C programme.
<br> Example:
<br> Input seconds:300
<br> Expected Output:H:M:S - 0:5:00
32. Make a C programme that accepts the user's input of 4 positive integers (p, q, r, and s) and an even number (p). Print "Correct values" if q is more than r, s is greater than p, and the total of r, s, and p is greater than the sum of p and q; else, print "Wrong values."
<br>Example:
<br>Input the second integer: 35
<br>Input the third integer: 15
<br>Input the fourth integer: 46
<br>Expected Output: Wrong values
33.Create a C programme that accepts two numbers and a string (n1, n2). The characters in the string between n1 and n2 should now be reversed.
<br> Example:
<br> ("abcdxyabcd", 5, 6) -> "abcdyxabcd"
<br> ("Exercises", 1, 3) -> "exercises"
34. Create a C programme that takes two sequences of numbers as input: ((a1, a2,.. an), (b1, b2,.. bn)). Find each integer, one by one, in ascending order that appears in both sequences.
<br> Constraints: 
<br> 1≤N1≤100, N1 -> number of integers in first sequence. 
<br> 1≤N2≤100, N2 -> number of integers in second sequence. 
<br> 1 ≤ ai≤ 100 ( 1 ≤ i ≤ N1 ) 
<br> 1 ≤ bj≤ 100 ( 1 ≤ j ≤ N2 ) 
<br> Example: 
<br> ( 1 2 3 1 2 3 4) -> 1 2 3 ( 1 2 3 1 2 3) -> 1 2 3 (1 2 3 4 5 6)
35. Create a C program that will take a user-supplied series of positive numbers and calculate the length of the largest continuous subsequence from that sequence.
36. Create a C programme that inspect an integer array and return true if it includes either two even or two odd values all close together.
<br> Example:
<br> {1, 2, 3, 4} then o/p = 0
<br> {1,1,2,2,3} then o/p = 1
<br> {1,2,2,3,4,4} then o/p = 1
37. Write a C Program to display the pattern like pyramid using the alphabet. 
<pre><br> A B C D C B A 
<br>   A B C B A 
<br>     A B A 
<br>       A
</pre>
38. Make a C program of Addition of two numbers Using a recursive function.
39. Make a C program to Find out the sum of series 1 + x2 /2! - x 3 /3!+....
40. 
41. write a C program to discover the biggest element utilizing dynamic memory allocation.
42. Create a C programme that uses a pointer to count the vowels and consonants in a string. 
43. Create a C programme that uses a pointer to print a string backwards.
44. Make a C programme that utilises an array-returning function to get the highest and lowest value in a set of integers.
45. Create a C programme that read a user-provided string that serves as their password without displaying it on screen.
<br> Here is a list of the duties involved in reading a password string:
<br> • We should read characters aloud rather than projecting them into a screen. We must instead use the '*' character.
<br> • Before the user hits the enter key, we should read the input.
<br> • When a user touches the Backspace key, the following steps should be taken:
<br> • Eliminate his most recent character from the input string.
<br> • Move the cursor back 1 character, then remove the final star character from the screen.
46. Use arrays write a C programme to return a number of values or multiple values from a function.
47. C program to calculate total elapsed time by program/function i.e., the time taken to process the set of statements, complete function or complete program in C programming language
48. Write a C application to obtain and modify Windows' system date and time.
